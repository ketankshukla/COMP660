## What is wrong with the following code?

```
line 1:  pribt ()’Hello world!”)

```

There are 3 things that are wrong with this line of code.

1 - The print command has a typo in it. It should be print, and not pribt.

2 - The way the quotes are used is incorrect because they are mismatched. In Python, the string literals should always
have matching quotes - which are either single quotes ' ' or double quotes " ".

3 - Finally, there is an extra closing parentheses immediately after the opening parentheses. The correct syntax of the
function call should have matching parentheses around the argument.

Therefore the correct code is either with the double quotes:

```
print("Hello, world!")
```

Or with the single quotes:

```
print('Hello, world!')
```
