#### Question 1 - What function is used to get the ASCII code of a character ?

The function used to get the ASCII code of a character in Python is `ord()`.

For example:

```python
ascii_code = ord('A')
print(ascii_code)  # Output: 65
```

The `ord()` function takes a single character as input
and returns its corresponding ASCII (or Unicode) code.

You can run the above code in Question 1.py file
