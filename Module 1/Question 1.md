## What is a program?

A program is basically a set of instructions given to a machine to perform a specific task or a series of tasks.

The program is written in a specific programming language, and in this course, that language is Python. 

A program is responsible for laying out or defining the various decisions that must be followed by a machine in order to 
be able to come up with a solution.

The solution could include manipulating data, or even controlling other pieces of hardware.

### Main parts of a program

A program has the following parts:

#### 1 - Instructions. 

This is a series of statements that are given to the computer so that the execution of those
statements can result in a solution. Example of these statements could include mathematical operations, processing data
or even interacting with the user. 

#### 2 - One or more programming languages.

Programs are written in languages that very from low-level Assembly all the way to high-level Python. They are mostly
written in high-level languages, such as Python, because reading the syntax of high-level languages can be easily read
by a human being. 

### 3 - A type of program

Programs can be classified in various categories, such as application programs, system programs, utility programs, 
just to name a few. 

Application programs or Apps, are primarily created for the end users to perform specific tasks, such as using Excel to 
work with spreadsheets and browsers to surf the internet, such as Chrome. 

Then you have System programs, which manage the underlying hardware and provide services to other programs such as
operating systems. 

Then you have utility programs, and these perform system maintenance tasks such as antivurus and disk management tools.

Examples of programs include web browsers, apps like the ones in the app stores as well as web apps and desktop apps
and even video games for entertainment, which are highly interactive
