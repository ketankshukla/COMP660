### What is the output of the code below? 

Could you explain what happened ?

```python
letter = "Hizthere,zThisziszhowzazpasszstatementzworks!"
for i in letter:
if i == "mn":
pass
elif i == "z":
print(" ",end="")
else:
print(i, end="")
```
### Answer:

This is the output of the code (run the Question 2.py file)

```
Hi there, This is how a pass statement works!
```

1. The string `letter` is defined with 'z' characters used as separators.

2. The code loops through each character in the `letter` string.

3. For each character, it checks three conditions:

   a. If the character is "mn":
   This condition is never met because "mn" are two characters, and we're checking one character at a time. 
   The `pass` statement here does nothing and is never executed.

   b. If the character is "z":
   When a 'z' is encountered, it prints a space instead of the 'z'. 
   This effectively replaces all 'z' characters with spaces.

   c. For any other character:
   It prints the character as is, without adding a new line (due to `end=""`)

4. The `end=""` parameter in the `print()` function ensures that all characters are printed 
   on the same line, rather than each on a new line.

The code replaces all 'z' characters with spaces and prints all other characters as they are, 
resulting in the sentence "Hi there, This is how a pass statement works!" 
without any line breaks.

The `pass` statement in this code is never reached and doesn't affect the output. 
It acts like a placeholder for code to be added later.
