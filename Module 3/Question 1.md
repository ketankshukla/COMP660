## What is the difference between “pass” and “continue” in Python?

### Answer:

The "pass" and "continue" statements in Python serve different purposes in control flow:

1. pass:
    - "pass" is really a null operation - it doesn't do anything.
   
    - It's used as a placeholder where syntactically some code is required, but no action is desired.
   
    - It allows you to have empty code blocks without causing syntax errors.
   
    - It's often used in places where code will eventually be added, or to create minimal classes or functions.

2. continue:
    - "continue" is used inside loops (for or while).
   
    - It skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.
   
    - When "continue" is encountered, the program jumps to the next iteration without executing any remaining code in the current iteration.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference:

```python
# Using pass
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        pass  # Does nothing, continues with the next line
    print(i)

# Output: 0 1 2 3 4

# Using continue
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue  # Skips the rest of the loop for this iteration
    print(i)

# Output: 0 1 3 4
```

In the "pass" example, all numbers are printed. 
In the "continue" example, 2 is skipped because the loop moves to the next iteration when i == 2.

The differences summarized:
- Use "pass" when you need a placeholder for future code or to create empty structures.
- Use "continue" when you want to skip the rest of the current loop iteration and move to the next one.
