#### An entity or concept is said to be recursive when simpler or smaller self-similar instances form part of its constituents. Provide an example in nature or art where we can observe this property.

#### Answer

A simple example of where we can observe recursion in nature, is a tree. The branches split into smaller branches, and
those smaller branches split again, just like the bigger ones. It's the same pattern, just repeating in a smaller way.

Another example is a snowflake. When you look closely, each arm of the snowflake has a similar pattern repeating itself,
just getting smaller and smaller. Same goes for seashells like the nautilus. They spiral in on themselves, and if you
zoom in, the spiral shape keeps repeating in a smaller way. Itâ€™s that same idea of the bigger shape containing smaller
versions of itself.
