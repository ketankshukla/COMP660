#### Question 2 - Take the following Python code that stores a string: str = 'inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0'. Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon inet address character and then use the rstrip function to remove any trailing characters.

Hereâ€™s my solution on how to achieve that:

```python
str = 'inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0'

start_position = str.find(':')

ip_address = str[start_position + 1:].split()[0].rstrip()

mask_position = str.find(':', start_position + 1)

mask = str[mask_position + 1:].rstrip()

print(f"The IP Address is - {ip_address}")
print(f"The Mask is - {mask}")
```

### What the code does:

String Creation:

Creates a string variable containing IP address and mask information
Format is 'inet addr:[IP]  Mask:[MASK]'

Finding First Colon:

start_position = str.find(':') locates the first colon
This finds the colon after 'inet addr'
Returns the index position where the colon is found

Extracting IP Address:

str[start_position + 1:] gets everything after the first colon
.split() breaks this into a list using whitespace as separator
[0] selects the first element (127.0.0.1)
.rstrip() removes any trailing whitespace

Finding Second Colon:

str.find(':', start_position + 1) finds the second colon
Starts searching after the first colon position
Returns the index position of colon after 'Mask'

Extracting Mask:

str[mask_position + 1:] gets everything after the second colon
.rstrip() removes any trailing whitespace

Output:

Prints "The IP Address is - 127.0.0.1"
Prints "The Mask is - 255.0.0.0"

You can run the above code in Question 2.py file
