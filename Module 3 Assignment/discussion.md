### What is a "pass" in Python?

A "pass" statement in Python is a null operation. It does nothing when executed, 
but serves as a placeholder where syntactically some code is required. 

Key points about "pass":

- It's used when a statement is required syntactically but you don't want any code to execute.
- Common use cases include:
    - Creating minimal classes or functions
    - Serving as a placeholder for future code
    - In conditional statements where no action is needed
- It allows you to create code structures without causing syntax errors.

Example:
```python
if condition:
  pass  # TODO: Add code here later
else:
  execute_some_code()
```

### What is a "docstring" in Python and why is it used?

A docstring (short for documentation string) is a string literal that appears as 
the first statement in a module, function, class, or method in Python. 

Key points about docstrings:

- They are enclosed in triple quotes (''' or """)
- Used to describe what a module, function, class, or method does
- Can be accessed using the .__doc__ attribute of the object
- Provide a convenient way of associating documentation with Python modules, functions, classes, and methods

Docstrings are used for several reasons:
- To provide a brief explanation of the purpose and functionality of the code
- To document parameters, return values, and exceptions raised
- To offer examples of how to use the code
- To make the code more maintainable and understandable for other developers (including your future self)
- Many tools (like Sphinx) can automatically generate documentation from docstrings

Example:

```python
"""
Check if a person is an adult based on their age.

This code snippet determines whether a person is considered an adult
or a minor based on their age. The age threshold for adulthood is set
at 18 years.

Variables:
age (int): The age of the person to check.

Output:
Prints a string stating whether the person is an "Adult" or a "Minor".

Example:
If age is set to 20, the output will be:
"The person is an Adult"

If age is set to 16, the output will be:
"The person is a Minor"
"""

age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("The person is an Adult")
else:
    print("The person is a Minor")
```
