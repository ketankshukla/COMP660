The source code in Python is written in .py files using text that is readable by humans 
and follows Python's syntax rules. 

When a Python script is run, the Python interpreter first compiles the code in the .py file 
into another form known as bytecode. 

This intermediate form is a lower-level, platform-independent set of instructions specific to 
the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), but it is not directly executable by the hardware. 

The compiled bytecode is stored in .pyc files in the __pycache__ directory, allowing the interpreter 
to skip the compilation step if the source code hasn’t changed in subsequent executions.

When the script is executed, the PVM reads the compiled bytecode and executes it line-by-line. 
This step is where the program actually runs, with the PVM interpreting the bytecode instructions 
and interacting with the computer’s hardware and operating system. The PVM is part of the runtime 
environment and acts as the interpreter, rather than compiling the code directly into machine-specific instructions, 
which is why Python is known as an interpreted language.

Before bytecode is generated, the interpreter performs several steps. 
First, it breaks down the source code into a series of tokens. 
These are the smallest building blocks of the code, including keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals. 
The tokens are then passed to a parser, which arranges them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representing the 
code’s structure according to Python’s syntax rules. At this point, the interpreter checks for syntax errors to 
ensure the code is well-formed.

Once the AST is created, the interpreter carries out semantic analysis to verify the logical correctness of the code, 
checking things like variable scope and type mismatches. After passing these checks, the AST is compiled into bytecode, 
which is then stored in .pyc files. By compiling to this intermediate form, Python can use the cached bytecode for 
future runs, making execution faster.

The final step involves the PVM interpreting the bytecode. 
It executes each instruction one by one, interacting with the system’s resources as needed. 
Some Python implementations, like PyPy, include a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which further optimizes the 
execution by translating bytecode into machine code at runtime. This can significantly speed up the performance 
for frequently executed code segments.

This entire process, from source code to bytecode compilation and interpretation by the PVM, 
makes Python a flexible and portable language. The use of bytecode allows the same Python code to run on different 
operating systems, and the caching mechanism speeds up subsequent executions. Additionally, Python’s interpreted 
nature provides ease of debugging, as errors can be caught and corrected during runtime.
